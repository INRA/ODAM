This is because the consistency of the data must be ensured throughout the experiment, so that it becomes unnecessary for each member to conduct a laborious investigation to find out who has the correct identifiers. Each time we plan to share data coming from a common experimental design, the classical challenges for fast using data by every partner are data storage and data access. We propose an approach for sharing project data all along its development phase, from the setup of the experimental schema up to the data acquisition from the various analyzes of samples, so that all data is readily available as soon as they are generated. Proposed solution # ODAM software is designed to manage experimental data tables in a quick and easy way for users. There is no need to develop a complex data model. Just complete the data with some structural metadata. These structural metadata will be used first to make full use of the data as soon as they are produced and formatted and then to annotate the dataset for later dissemination, either to project partners or more widely. The core idea in one shot The central idea which has been the founding idea of ODAM, is that data producers \"just\" have to drag and drop their data tables onto a storage space, which depending on the chosen infrastructure can be local (i.e. their PC, or a NAS) or remote (virtual disk space). So simply dropping data files (along with two additional metadata files) on the storage space allows users to access them through web services. This means there is no need for additional configuration on the server. ODAM proposes to meet certain needs typically encountered during the implementation of an experimental design in life science including several different analyses of the same sample. 1 - Data collecting and preparation The formatting of all the data and matching the data from the different analyses with their experimental context can be a long step. Tasks such as collecting and preparing data in order to combine several data sources require a lot of long, repetitive and tedious manipulations. Similarly, when modeling, subsets must be selected and then many scenarios with different parameters must be tested. 2 - Data sharing Enabling centralized management of identifiers (e.g. plants, crops, samples, etc.) so that they are unique and shared by all project members. Indeed, as each biological sample is most often aliquoted and then sent for analysis by different techniques, the data returned in tabular form must be able to be linked to the other data according to the identifiers of the samples Giving access to data for rapid use by each project member and this throughout the development phase, from the implementation of the experimental design to the acquisition of data from the various sample analyses, so that all data are readily available as soon as they are generated. 3 - Data publishing To be able to publish one's data without a colossal effort of formatting, and without the need for data archaeology. To be able to publish one's data according to the FAIR principles , at least the essentials To facilitate the reuse of data by providing structural metadata, thus avoiding that data consumers spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to understand the digital resources they need and devising specific ways to combine them. ODAM sofware suite allows experimental data tables to be widely accessible and fully reusable and this with minimal effort on the part of the data provider. Easily structure your data by adding structural metadata so that you can first exploit it locally yourself, before sharing it more widely just as easily. make research data locally or broadly accessible all along the project allow data to be selected then, downloadable by web API allow data and analysis to be visualized online Based on the following criteria: Centrally manage identifiers (plants, harvests, samples, ...) so that they are unique and shared by all Avoid the implementation of a complex data management system (requiring a data model) given that many changes can occur during the project. (possibility of new analysis, new measures or give up some others, ...) Facilitates the subsequent publication of data: either the data can serve to fill in an existing database or the data can be broadcast through a web-service approach with the associated metadata. For this work, we made the choice to keep the good old way of scientist to use worksheets, thus using the same tool for both data files and metadata definition files.

To have a URL as reference for the data files, it is necessary to add at the end of the request '?links=1' ODAM data-package on github https://github.com/djacob65/odam-datapackage Frictionless Data Specifications http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/ https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs/tree/master/schemas json_validate: Validate a json file https://rdrr.io/cran/jsonvalidate/man/json_validate.html","title":"ODAM data-package based on JSON-Schema"},{"location":"json-schema/#example-of-a-session-under-r-using-a-data-package","text":"library ( httr ) library ( jsonvalidate ) library ( jsonlite ) # Get the ODAM data package schema response <- GET ( 'https://inrae.github.io/ODAM/json-schema/odam-data-package.json' , config ( sslversion = 6 , ssl_verifypeer = 1 )) schema <- rawToChar ( response $ content ) # Get structural metadata information in datapackage format (json) # for the 'frim1' dataset directly from an ODAM repository # (located on https://pmb-bordeaux.fr) # As the option links is set to 1, we will have the absolute reference # for data files (see below) response <- GET ( 'https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/json/frim1/datapackage?links=1' , config ( sslversion = 6 , ssl_verifypeer = 1 )) json <- rawToChar ( response $ content ) # Validate the JSON against the ODAM data package schema jsonvalidate :: json_validate ( json , schema ) [1] TRUE Code # Parse the JSON object to a data.frame metadata <- fromJSON ( json ) # List some metadata about the dataset metadata $ resources[ c ( \"name\" , \"title\" , \"identifier\" , \"obtainedFrom\" , \"joinkey\" ) ] Output name title identifier obtainedFrom joinkey 1 plants Plant features PlantID <NA> <NA> 2 samples Sample features SampleID plants PlantID 3 aliquots Aliquots features AliquotID samples SampleID 4 cellwall_metabo Cell wall Compound quantifications AliquotID aliquots AliquotID 5 cellwall_metaboFW Cell Wall Compound quantifications (FW) AliquotID aliquots AliquotID 6 activome Activome Features AliquotID aliquots AliquotID 7 pools Pools of remaining pools PoolID samples SampleID 8 qMS_metabo MS Compounds quantification PoolID pools PoolID 9 qNMR_metabo NMR Compounds quantification PoolID pools PoolID 10 plato_hexosesP Hexoses Phosphate AliquotID aliquots AliquotID 11 lipids_AG Lipids AG AliquotID aliquots AliquotID 12 AminoAcid Amino Acids AliquotID aliquots AliquotID Code # List the absolute reference for data files metadata $ resources[ \"path\" ] Output path 1 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/plants 2 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/samples 3 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/aliquots 4 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/cellwall_metabo 5 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/cellwall_metaboFW 6 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/activome 7 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/pools 8 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/qMS_metabo 9 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/qNMR_metabo 10 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/plato_hexosesP 11 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/lipids_AG 12 https://pmb-bordeaux.fr/getdata/tsv/frim1/AminoAcid Code # Read the 'samples' data file - index=2 index <- 2 M <- read.table ( url ( metadata $ resources[ \"path\" ] $ path[index] ), header = metadata $ resources $ dialect $ header[index] , sep = metadata $ resources $ dialect $ delimiter[index] ) # Display an extract M[1 : 10 , ] Output SampleID PlantID Truss DevStage FruitAge HarvestDate HarvestHour FruitPosition FruitDiameter FruitHeight FruitFW FruitDW DW 1 1 A26 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 2 NA NA 0.72 0.090216 NA 2 1 C2 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 3 NA NA 0.56 0.070168 NA 3 1 D15 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 4 NA NA 0.78 0.097734 NA 4 1 E19 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 4 NA NA 0.66 0.082698 NA 5 1 E34 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 3 NA NA 0.7 0.087710 NA 6 1 E38 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 3 NA NA 0.7 0.087710 NA 7 1 H29 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 5 NA NA 1.24 0.155372 NA 8 1 H34 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 4 NA NA 0.86 0.107758 NA 9 1 H52 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 5 NA NA 0.77 0.096481 NA 10 1 H61 T5 FF.01 08DPA 40379 0.5 5 NA NA 0.56 0.070168 NA Code # Get the list of data subsets that were obtained from the 'samples' index <- 2 subsets <- metadata $ resources $ schema $ foreignKey[[index]] $ reference[ , 1 ] if ( !
