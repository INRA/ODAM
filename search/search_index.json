This is because the consistency of the data must be ensured throughout the experiment, so that it becomes unnecessary for each member to conduct a laborious investigation to find out who has the correct identifiers. Each time we plan to share data coming from a common experimental design, the classical challenges for fast using data by every partner are data storage and data access. We propose an approach for sharing project data all along its development phase, from the setup of the experimental schema up to the data acquisition from the various analyzes of samples, so that all data is readily available as soon as they are generated. ODAM software is designed to manage experimental data tables in a quick and easy way for users without high computer skills. The core idea in one shot ODAM proposes to meet certain needs typically encountered during the implementation of an experimental design in life science including several different analyses of the same sample. Based on the following criteria: Centrally manage identifiers (plants, harvests, samples, ...) so that they are unique and shared by all Avoid the implementation of a complex data management system (requiring a data model) given that many changes can occur during the project.
